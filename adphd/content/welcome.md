# Welcome to AD(P)HD

Here you'll find articles spanning several areas of science and
technologym focussing on fundamental aspects of the molecular sciences
and the use of programming to explore these ideas.

Our interests include (but are not limited to):

* Molecular Quantum Mechanics
* Molecular Graphics
* Crystallography
* Programming Paradigms
* Local and Global Optimization

We'll strive to post on a weekly basis. Feel free to make requests on
the comments section and, time and knowledge allowing, we'll see what
we can do!

Yours trully,

The team at **AD(P)HD**.

(By the way, I've gotta test a formula, so here goes: $\pi=3.141$)
