In potential theory, we concern ourselves not with the determination of motion of particles given
known forces, but rather with the problem of finding forces from a knowledge of the position of 
other bodies in our system.

In molecular systems, we concern ourselves at the intermolecular level with exchane, repulsion and
electrostatic forces. The latter, being the strongest of conrtibutions with lowest distance
dependence, is subject to the inverse square law, determined by the positions of other masses and 
their charges.

### Gravitational and Electrostatic Potentials

\begin{equation}
    \label{gravpot}
    \Phi (\vec{r})
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \label{elcstatpot}
    \phi (\vec{r})
\end{equation}
